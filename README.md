Useful talks to listen/watch

### Software Development - General
- [One Hacker Way - Erik Meijer](https://vimeo.com/110554082) <br>
Meijer has a clear stance on how this is going to go down, and it starts with, well, killing Agile. Or at least, killing the idea of blindly following the methods. <br>
Instead of talking about code, Meijer thinks that we should go the Facebookian Hacker Way. Itâ€™s an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. The best idea with the best implementation should always win.<br>
Just push it to production. It will fail, but testing is only about writing tests, not real code. If it breaks, fix it! TDD is for pussies!<br>
